# Copilot instructions — portfolio-infra

`AGENTS.md` at the repository root is the authoritative instruction file; follow it. Summary:

- Specification: `docs/DESIGN.md`. Workflow: `docs/ENGINEERING.md`. Memory: read `HANDOFF.md` first and check it against `main` and the open PRs; read the newest `docs/AGENT_LOG.md` entries; add a log entry at the end of every PR and rewrite `HANDOFF.md` at the end of every session.
- Test-driven development: failing test first, then implementation, then refactor.
- Small stacked PRs on plain GitHub (`stack/<topic>/<nn>-<slug>`), Conventional Commits, never push to `main`.
- Stack: TypeScript (Node) action and scripts, pnpm, Biome, Vitest, esbuild. Check all: `pnpm check`.
- No dependencies outside `docs/DESIGN.md` §6 without justification; never commit secrets.
